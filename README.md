[![Nightly Testing](https://github.com/SegmentLinking/cmssw/actions/workflows/nightly-testing.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SegmentLinking/cmssw/actions/workflows/nightly-testing.yml)

This fork is used for internal development and validation of the Line Segment Tracking (LST) algorithm. This particular branch is only used to configure our custom CI to check PRs. To look at the code, please view [our master branch](https://github.com/SegmentLinking/cmssw/tree/master), which tracks the [upstream master branch](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw) of the official CMSSW repository.
